/*

this code works with a global $route that points to a folder which itself contains a folder called "raw_data".
that folder should contain .csv files that need to be appended to one another.
this can be adapted to other file types.
the output from this code is placed in the $route folder, outside of the raw_data folder.

*this code puts every .csv in the raw_data folder together!
cd "$route\raw_data"
tempfile building
save `building', emptyok
local filenames : dir "$route\raw_data" files "*.csv"
foreach f of local filenames {
	import delimited using `"`f'"' , rowrange(1:10000) varnames(1) stringcols(_all) clear
	append using `building'
	save `"`building'"', replace
	}
save "$route\appended_data", replace
