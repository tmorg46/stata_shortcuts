# stata_shortcuts
this is all of my nice stata shortcut stuff, all in one place

- allfiles_appender:
used to append lots of datasets to each other in Stata.

- allstates:
line one is a ready-to-go global macro of state and territory strings for Stata.
the rest of the file is some example code with stuff to look out for, followed by
lines of code with the states in lower, Proper, and UPPER cases, with and without "".

- month_labeler:
use this code to label month variables that range from 1-12 with their respective names.

- split_merge_append:
use this technique when you're trying to merge huge datasets that your computer
can't handle in one step.

- template_01_firstthing:
a template for the do-files I write in my project organization strategy

- template_hq:
a template for the do-file that runs the other do-files in each of my projects
