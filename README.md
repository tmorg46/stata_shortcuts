# stata_shortcuts
this is all of my nice stata shortcut stuff, all in one place

- allstates:
just lines of codes with the states in lower, Proper, and UPPER cases, with and without "".

- file_appender:
used to append lots of datasets to each other in Stata.

- global_allstates:
line one is a ready-to-go global macro of state and territory strings for Stata.
the rest of the file is some example code with stuff to look out for.

- template_01_firstthing:
a template for the do-files I write in my project organization strategy

- template_hq:
a template for the do-file that runs the other do-files in each of my projects
