# stata_shortcuts
this is all of my nice stata shortcut stuff, all in one place

- allstates:
just lines of codes with the states in lower, Proper, and UPPER cases, with and without "".

- file_appender:
used to append lots of datasets to each other in Stata.

- global_allstates:
line one is a ready-to-go global macro of state and territory strings for Stata.
the rest of the file is some example code with stuff to look out for.
